    <p>We're no strangers to love
        You know the rules and so do I (do I)<br>
        A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
        You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
        Gotta make you understand<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
        Never gonna make you cry<br>
        Never gonna say goodbye<br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
        We've known each other for so long<br>
        Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)<br>
        Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)<br>
        We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
        And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
        Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
        Never gonna make you cry<br>
        Never gonna say goodbye<br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you</p>
